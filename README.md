# Validus_Case_Study
Case Study: Foreign Exchange Rate Simulation and Hedging of FX Risk Quantitative Analyst

The aim of this exercise is to expose you to the kind of problems you will be working on and for us to evaluate how you can independently bring your own knowledge up. You are allowed and encouraged to search for reference materials that will help you undergo your task and we would also be happy to discuss your findings. We ask that you complete the case study and send your results back to us along with the approximate amount of time you spent. 
Please attempt this case study using Python and send us the codes by https://github.com/.
We hope you can gain a better insight of what you would be doing as a member of the Quant Team at Validus, learn about the Alternative Asset Management space and hopefully enjoy the time spent while working on this.
